# Chat Saver  
## By rxkt#2283  
  
  
### How to use:  
  
  **To change settings:**  
  1. Change your chat settings to whatever your preferences are.  
  2. `/8 savechat` to save your preferences.  
  
  **To load settings:**  
  1. `/8 loadchat` and relog.  
  
  
  ### **IMPORTANT NOTE**  
  Use `/8 savechat` quickly after changing chat settings for best results.  
  The client automatically sends Chat UI settings packets every 5-10 seconds for whatever reason and that may mess up your settings.  
  I suggest fixing your settings all at once, then doing a final apply/save and doing `/8 savechat`.
